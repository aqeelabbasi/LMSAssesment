Hi Abc  I just wanted to officially introduce myself: I’m cde, I started on July 1st and I’ll hopefully be supporting you all in the Telco area as a UX Researcher.
I’d really love it if we could get to know each other a bit better personally and if you could give me a little insight into your role in the Telco sector 
 If you’re up for it and have some time, I’d be thrilled if we could set up a coffee chat. Let me know if you’re interested, and I’ll look for a time slot that works for us
